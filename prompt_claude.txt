I need a Python GUI application for splitting audio files with these specific requirements:

1. Features needed:
- Load audio file (MP3 or WAV)
- Play/pause audio with slider control (NO autoplay when loading file)
- Mark split points during playback
- Save/load work progress via config file
- Split audio at marked points
- Convert segments to WAV (22050Hz, 16-bit, mono)
- Configure starting segment number in config file (used only first time with empty output directory)
- Continue numbering segments from last number after first run
- Track last split position between sessions

2. GUI elements:
- Create/Load config buttons
- Play/Pause button
- Mark Point button
- Forward/Back 5s buttons
- Progress slider
- Time display (MM:SS)
- Split points list
- Remove point button
- Split audio button

3. Config file (.json) structure:
{
    "input_audio_file": path,
    "output_directory": path,
    "metadata_file": path,
    "split_points": [],
    "last_position": 0,
    "start_segment_number": number  # Used only on first run
}

4. Dependencies:
- tkinter for GUI (including simpledialog)
- pygame for audio playback
- pydub for audio processing
- Other standard libraries (json, csv, os, etc.)

5. Critical features:
- NO autoplay when loading config or audio file
- Remember last split position when restarting
- Continue splitting from last position
- Use start_segment_number only when output directory is empty
- Maintain correct segment numbering after first run
- Save split points as timestamps
- Update metadata.csv with segment filenames
- Convert to mono WAV with correct specs

Please create this audio splitting application with exact implementation as specified, ensuring manual playback control and proper segment numbering based on config and directory state.
